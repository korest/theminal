Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post on my terminal-themed website.

## Why a Terminal Theme?

As developers, we spend a lot of time in the terminal. It's where we feel most productive and at home. This theme brings that familiar aesthetic to the web.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Software development best practices
- DevOps and infrastructure
- CLI tools and productivity tips
- Random thoughts on technology

Stay tuned for more posts!
